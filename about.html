    <p>
      I’m <strong>Shriya Trivedi</strong> — a passionate learner and creative individual who believes that growth comes through continuous exploration and meaningful experiences. 
      I love blending creativity with purpose, learning from every opportunity, and striving to make a positive impact through both education and design.
    </p>

    <p>
      I currently work as a <strong>Junior Teacher at AN Classes</strong>, Sahara State, where I teach and guide students in their academic journey. 
      This role has not only strengthened my communication and leadership skills but has also taught me the joy of seeing students grow, 
      improve, and gain confidence in themselves. Teaching has truly become one of my most fulfilling experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside teaching, I’m also part of the <strong>Creative Team of the Career Counselling and Placement Cell</strong> at 
      <strong>Isabella Thoburn College</strong>. Here, I contribute to designing digital content, creating posters, and developing visuals for 
      various events and initiatives. My role allows me to combine creativity and communication — expressing ideas through visuals that inspire students and professionals alike.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond work, I love <strong>exploring and learning</strong> new things that enhance my creativity and knowledge — from discovering design trends to improving my digital skills. 
      I actively share my experiences and achievements on <strong>LinkedIn</strong>, where I connect with educators, mentors, and professionals who continue to inspire my journey of growth and collaboration.
