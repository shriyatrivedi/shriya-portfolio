    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I’m Shriya Trivedi — a passionate learner and creative explorer who loves blending knowledge with imagination.
      Currently, I’m working as a Junior Teacher at AN Classes, Sahara State, where I aim to make learning engaging
      and meaningful for students. Along with teaching, I’m also an active part of the Career Counselling and Placement
      Cell at Isabella Thoburn College, where I design posters and visuals through Canva.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey so far has been about learning, creating, and connecting with people who inspire growth — and I look
      forward to exploring even more opportunities that help me grow personally and professionally.
    </p>
