          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I’m <strong>Shriya Trivedi</strong> — a passionate learner and creative explorer who loves blending knowledge with imagination.
            Currently, I’m working as a Junior Teacher at AN Classes, Sahara State, where I aim to make learning engaging and meaningful for students.
          </p>

          <p>
            Along with teaching, I’m also an active part of the Career Counselling and Placement Cell at Isabella Thoburn College, 
            where I contribute to the creative team by designing posters, visuals, and digital content through Canva.
          </p>

          <h3>Teaching at AN Classes</h3>
          <p>
            At AN Classes, I get the chance to teach, guide, and connect with students every day.
            Teaching has helped me grow as a communicator, mentor, and learner — where I discovered how small efforts can inspire big changes.
          </p>

          <h3>Creative Team – Career Counselling & Placement Cell</h3>
          <p>
            Alongside teaching, I’m part of the Creative Team at Isabella Thoburn College, where I design event posters and digital visuals through Canva — 
            blending ideas with visuals that bring our initiatives to life.
          </p>

          <h3>Exploring and Learning</h3>
          <p>
            I believe creativity grows when you keep exploring. Whether it’s designing, learning new tools, or taking on new challenges, 
            I enjoy staying curious and open to everything that helps me improve and express better.
          </p>

          <h3>LinkedIn Presence</h3>
          <p>
            I actively share my journey and achievements on LinkedIn, connecting with professionals and mentors who motivate me to keep learning and growing.
            My profile reflects not just my work, but also my enthusiasm for continuous development.
